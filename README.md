<p>The MSPACMAM (Model of Sinking Particles and Cycling of Marine Aggregated Matter) is a cost-efficient numerical 1-D model that carries four different particle tracers in small and large size classes to interactively calculate the sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) flux. The MSPACMAM attempts to include all the most important processes governing the temporal evolution of particle tracer content in a vertical grid cell, including gravitational settling of particles, respiratory decomposition of organic matter (POC), mineral (calcite, aragonite, and opal) dissolution, and fragmentation of large particles into small ones. The effects of particle size and density, dissolved oxygen, calcite and aragonite saturation states, and seawater temperature, density and viscosity on the rates of these processes are explicitly resolved.</p>
<p>The MSPACMAM is described thoroughly in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GB007131">Dinauer et al. (2022)</a>.</p>
<h3>Running the model</h3>
<p>After setting your preferences in the <em>config.m</em> file, the model is ready to run. You can run the model by running the <em>main.m</em> script.</p>
<p>More detailed instructions on how to run the model are forthcoming â€” stay tuned!</p>
